Advanced Simplifications:

Plus:
e1 - x + x = 2x
The addition of two identical expressions (or vars) will result in the multiplication of the expression by 2

e2 / e3 - x + (- x) = 0 || (- x) + x = 0
The addition of an expression with a negative self will result 0

e4 - x * a + x * b = x * (a + b)
The addition of two multiplication containing two identical components will result in gathering them inside brackets

e5 - log(y, x) + log(z, x) = log((y * x), x)
The addition of two logs with the same base will result in multiplication of the expressions that
were inside the two logs, in one log (log arithmetics)

Pow:
e6 - (x ^ y) ^ z = x ^ (y * z)
The power of an expression with a power will result in the multiplication of the powers (power arithmetics)

Minus:
e7 - x - (- y) =  x + y
The subtraction of an expression with a negative expression will result in the addition of the two given expressions

e8 - x * a - x * b = x * (a - b)
The subtraction of two multiplication containing two identical components will result in gathering them inside brackets

e9 - log(y, x) - log(z, x) = log((y / x), x)
The subtraction of two logs with the same base will result in division of the expressions that
were inside the two logs, in one log (log arithmetics)

Mult:
e10 - x * x = x ^ 2 
The multiplication of two identical expressions will result the expression with a power of 2

e11 - x * (y / x) = y
The multiplication of an expression with a division expression when the denominator is an expression identical to the multiplied
expression to the left (or right!), will result the numerator (basic division arithmetics)

e12 - x ^ n * x ^ m = x ^ (n + m)
The multiplication of two identical expressions with different powers will result in the expression with a power -
that is the addition of the two diffrent powers (power arithmetics)

Div:
e13 - x ^ n / x ^ m = x ^ (n - m)
The division of two identical expressions with different powers will result in the expression with a power - 
that is the subtraction of the two diffrent powers (power arithmetics)

e14 - - x / x || x / - x = -1
The division of an expression with the negative self (or the other way around) will result with -1

Log:
e15 - log (y, (x ^ b)) = b * log (y, x)
If an expression inside a log has a power, remove the power from the log and multiplie the power's value with the log
(log arithmetics)

Neg:
e16 -    - (- x) = x
The negative result of a negative expression will result in a positive expression (same expression of course)

Sin:
e17 -  Sin (- x) = - Sin (x)
If the expression inside a Sine is negative, it will result in a negtive Sine with the expression (positive!) inside it
(Trigonometric identities)

Cos:
e18 - Cos (- x) =  Cos (x)
If the expression inside a Cosine is negative, it will result in a positive Cosine with the expression (positive!) inside it
(Trigonometric identities)

e19 - Cos (x + y) / Cos (y + x) = 1
The division of two identical expressions (also trigonometric as shown) will result 1, thus by checking the interior
expressions in the expression given

e20 - Sin (x) / Cos (x) = Tan (x)
The division of Sine expression by Cosine expression will result in a Tangent expression (trigonometric identities)
